# Stanford-Coursework

# For honor code reasons I am not at will to post source code from coursework, but I have it all saved.
# If you would like to see source code from coursework and you are not a student at Stanford (eg potential employers)
# then please email me (rthomp@stanford.edu) and I would be happy to email you source code.

# The following classes have involved non-trivial amounts of coding:

# CS 106b, CS 107, CS 109, CS124
# MS&E 211X
# STATS 200
