# Stanford-Coursework

For honor code reasons I am not at will to post source code from coursework, but I have it all saved. If you would like to see source code from coursework and you are not a student at Stanford (eg potential employers) then please email me (rthomp@stanford.edu) and I would be happy to email you source code.

The following classes have involved non-trivial amounts of coding:

### Comptuer science
* CS 106b (programming abstractions)
* CS 107 (computer organization and systems)
* CS 109 (probability for computer scientists)
* CS124 (natural language processing)
* CS221 (artificial intelligence)

### Management Science and Engineering
* MS&E 211X (optimization)
* MS&E 221 (stochasic processes)

### Statistics
* STATS 200 (statistical inference)
